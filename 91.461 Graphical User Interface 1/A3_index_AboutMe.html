      <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Chris Burbine a Computer Science student at Umass Lowell.  These pages were created for my GUI 1 programming course, but I hope to see them evolve into something more in the future. </p>

      <p>My interests include programming, games (of both the table top and electronic verity), and bad action movies.</p>

      <p>More will be added to this page in the future when I think of more relevant things about myself to talk about.</p>
