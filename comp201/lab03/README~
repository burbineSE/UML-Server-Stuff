Changes for out put work, did it by setting calculateCost in all the .h files
to virtual, then in the printPackageCosti used a base-class pointer to call the
differnt types of calculateCost form TwoDayPackage.h and OvernightPackage.h. 
Output if a bit wierd, in the sense that withthe amount of lines being output
is dosent fit on my screen.

PS: forgot about the nameing of the PDF, named PackagePDF.pdf in this case
