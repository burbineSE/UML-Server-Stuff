Section 1.2: In this case the exptions used in this code unnessarly slow down 
the  code by instead of just calculating the fib number, it goes through an 
exception check. The use of exceptions also tend to be very un-user freindly
as they are ing this case, througing an excecption but but not telling the 
client what to do.

Section 2.2: I found that the nothrow was much faster than the throw runs. 
for the throw runs i got:

av real: 0.649s
av user: 0.604s
av sys:  0.008s

for the nothrow runs i got:

av real: 0.019s
av user: 0.013s
av sys:  0.006s

The throw runs are in fact much longer int comparion. I think this is true 
because the code needs to take time to throw and catch the data.

Section 2.3: Id say from just looking at the code id say that the count would
be very close or exactly the same as the the return Fib number.

I was close my counter found that the throw count is one less than the Fib 
numer.

Section 2.4: Id say that in some situations will need an exception call, but
it might be better to call a pre-existing exception insted of creating one
of ones own exception. Over all i can see the need of them in some situations
where an excptions will be helpful, but not nessrealy needed.
