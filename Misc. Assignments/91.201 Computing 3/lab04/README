a) Because we dont know how to create a larger int, we have to use arrays
in order to layer things in with just ints. Any int, wheather called as an
int or a string, we layer each part of the number into an array and add each
indavisual part just as we would on paper, add the tens carry the one, add the
hundereds carrya the one and so on. This also works with strings by calling 
the overloaded +. 

b) The size of the Huge int can not be greater than 30 digits, at this point 
it does not have the implementation to cin, making it so that info cannot 
be placed the user. Main issue being that the program as it is does not have
many operators, so it can only add.

c) Something wrong with the mult operator, dont know if my "math" in the loops
are corect because the print out gives me nothing, just black space.

d) Not enough time to finish

e) Works
