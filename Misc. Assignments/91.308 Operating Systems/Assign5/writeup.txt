Degree of Success: 40%

Overall I did not finish the whole assignment, mostly because I never got a 
version of the buddy system working. Besides this I believe that I have the best
 fit and first fit systems working for the most part though they are not set up 
in the same way as we were told to. My code does not possess the req_array as 
outline in the data structs text file and thus my stucts do not hold as much 
information about them and their neighbors. In the context of the assignment the
 code is fine, but out side the confines of the assignment this code is not very
 versatile. 
My output seems to be along the same lines as shown in class, but I am unsure if
 it is exactly the same results, which I believe is a problem. Form what I 
remember my results should be the same as any other best/first fits that parse 
it and if my results are off there my be an issue.

Below are my overall results and some commands needed for my code:

First fit at 512KB: ./firstbest 1 524288
First fit at 1MB:   ./firstbest 1 1048576
Best fit at 512KB:  ./firstbest 2 524288 
Best fit at 1MB:    ./firstbest 2 1048576 

First fit 1MB:      Total Allocations 490 of 500
First fit 512KB:    Total Allocations 370 of 500
Best fit 1MB:       Total Allocations 491 of 500
Best fit 512KB:     Total Allocations 372 of 500
Buddy system 1MB:   N/A
Buddy system 512KB: N/A
