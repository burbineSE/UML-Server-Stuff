Degree of success: %100

Discussion: The main issue I had with this assignment was the timing of the 
different parent and child actions, but after the Thursday class I found that I
 was over thinking the set up and where everything should be called was much 
simpler than I had originally assumed. In short most of the problems I was 
having with this assignment were resolved in the Thursday class.
