Discussion: The main issue I had with this assignment was remembering all of 
the parts necessary to get the result I was looking for in this assignment. It 
came down mainly to printing information correctly and dealing with the pipes. 
It took me some time to to figure out why I wasn't getting any information out 
of pfdin[0] until I realized that I handed fdopn-ed it to my par_infile 
(something which I believe was told to us in class to do, but I forgot about). 
I also ran into some issues with printing information, specificity with my 
function that printed out that lined of dots which counted the out the amount 
of information passed. I solved the issue by adding the lines "printf("\n");" 
and "fflush(stdout);" before attempting to print the dots.

Observations of cs308a2_grep_data_2 compared to cs308a2_grep_data_1: With 
cs308a2_grep_data_1 everything outputted as expected. My program spat out all 
of the lines containing a '123' in them and counted the number of lines found 
as intended; cs308a2_grep_data_2, however did not do this. With 
cs308a2_grep_data_2 there was to much information to sort through with caused 
both the inbound side pipe to the child and the outbound side of the other pipe 
to the parent to fill up causing them to both block on their respective end of 
their pipes, effectively freezing the program in its tracks.
