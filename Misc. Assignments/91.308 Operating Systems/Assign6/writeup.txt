Overall I believe I did the assignment to completion for the most part. There 
are two things that I am a little uneasy about the first is that some of my 
i-node numbers that are printing have a negative number, I not sure if this is
 an issue as I don't recall any discussion about this in class. The second being
 the was my program prints its info, mainly that its rather inefficient. Other 
that these concerns my code appears to run correctly. 

Output can be seen in output.txt.
