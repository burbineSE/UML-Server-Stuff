File Listings
	-DBII_v1.2: is my most complete attempt at completing the project 
	 correctly through asking the user for input, which sends that input 
	 to a PHP file, it then then formats that data into a JSON file, 
	 finally return to the app and parsing the JSON
	-DBIIv12: this is my web-view attempt, this does work with the correct 
	 IP address, I attempted to create a modular solution for this that 
	 automatically grab the IP upon file load, but to no success
	-A3.php: is the PHP file for DBII_v1.2 unsure if this would actually 
	 work never got that far in the process 

Running DBIIv12: 
	Running is fairly simple in my experience, with the proper drivers 
installed and the correct IP Address entered in simply plug in the your device 
of choice and the app should launch automatically after hitting run and 
selecting which device to run on. If this does not work load up a web browser 
and then run the program.
	I was personally unable to install my app as I am running things off of
 a Kindle not an Android device. I checked Amazon's development site and there 
doesn’t seem to be a way to install from Android studio.
